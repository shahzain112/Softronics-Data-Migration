Enterprise Database Migration – SQL Server to PostgreSQL (Softronics Project)
📌 Project Overview
As part of a critical enterprise-level migration project for Softronics, I successfully led the end-to-end Database Migration process from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL for three large-scale production databases. The primary objective was to ensure full data and logic parity across both platforms while maintaining performance, integrity, and scalability.

🚀 Key Contributions
🔁 1. Schema and Table Migration
Migrated all database tables from SQL Server to PostgreSQL using custom Python scripts.

Ensured compatibility of data types and constraints between the two systems.

📦 2. Data Migration
Built an independent Python-based ETL process to extract data from SQL Server and load it into PostgreSQL.

Handled bulk inserts and ensured data integrity across millions of records.

🧠 3. Stored Procedure Conversion
Migrated 959+ stored procedures, originally written in T-SQL.

Developed a specialized script to convert SQL Server stored procedures to PostgreSQL-compatible SQL syntax.

Addressed syntax-level differences and procedural logic conflicts between the platforms.

For procedures involving output or return logic, I restructured them as PostgreSQL functions to ensure operational consistency.

🧪 4. Error Handling and Automation
Encountered and resolved critical issues during conversion (e.g., incompatible syntax, return values, control-of-flow logic).

Wrote a robust Python script to automatically detect, fix, and validate common migration errors.

⚙️ 5. Functions and Triggers Migration
Migrated all user-defined functions and triggers for each of the three databases.

Validated functionality post-migration through unit tests and comparison scripts.

🔄 6. Intelligent Handling of SAS-like Procedures
Some stored procedures in SQL Server included logic equivalent to SAS (Select, Update, Insert, Delete).

Since PostgreSQL stored procedures don’t return values directly, I restructured those procedures into functions with return types to replicate expected outputs and behaviors.
