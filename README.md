🚀 Welcome to My Data Engineering Portfolio – Softronics DB Migration Project
🔍 Overview
This repository highlights one of my most impactful contributions as a Data Engineer — a full-scale enterprise database migration from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL for Softronics, a project that demanded precision, deep database knowledge, and automation skills.

⚡ I didn't just migrate databases — I engineered a reliable, scalable, and automated process that solved real-world problems.

💡 What Makes This Project Stand Out?
✅ Multi-Database Migration (3 Full DBs)
Migrated three enterprise-level databases, each with its own complexities, legacy logic, and large-scale data.

Designed custom solutions for each — no shortcuts or one-size-fits-all approach.

🛠️ Python-Powered Automation
Wrote separate Python scripts for:

Schema migration (tables, columns, datatypes)

Data migration (with consistency checks)

Stored procedure transformation

Syntax correction & error resolution

📜 Over 950+ Stored Procedures Converted
Manually and programmatically converted complex SQL Server procedures (T-SQL) to PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL).

Transformed procedures with return values into PostgreSQL functions, ensuring logic parity and performance.

🔄 Trigger and Function Migration
Identified and rewrote all relevant triggers and user-defined functions.

Ensured functional testing and validations across both platforms.

🔍 Solving Real Migration Challenges
Faced issues with incompatible syntax, logic returns, and SAS-style operations inside procedures.

Developed and deployed intelligent solutions using Python, SQL, and domain knowledge to solve these bottlenecks.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Advanced SQL / PL/pgSQL

Cross-platform database migration

Python scripting and automation

Data validation and transformation

ETL pipeline design

Problem solving under production-level constraints

🌟 Why Should This Matter to You?
I approach data engineering not just as a technical job — but as a problem-solving mission. This project is proof of my ability to:

Own and deliver complex tasks from start to finish

Build resilient systems using scripting and database knowledge

Understand business-critical logic and re-engineer it for scalable performance

Work smart with automation while paying attention to the details

📫 Let’s Connect
If you're looking for someone who can hit the ground running on database systems, ETL pipelines, and data platform modernization — this project is just the beginning of what I bring to the table.
